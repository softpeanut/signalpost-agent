# Signalpost reference agent

This is a runnable starting point for the Signalpost company-research challenge. It is intentionally a solid baseline, not a winning submission.

The public universe contains 411,160 eligible companies. A valid entry must process at least 1,000; you may process 10,000 or the full universe.

## What it already does

- reads a batch of Norwegian organisation numbers;
- anchors identity in the Brønnøysund bulk registry;
- fetches official financials, roles, group links and registered workplaces;
- visits the registry-listed website and rejects weak entity matches;
- emits one terminal JSONL envelope per input;
- records sources, retrieval times, content hashes, request counts and latency;
- supports checkpoint/resume and a deterministic refresh replay;
- includes examples for external-footprint discovery and an evidence-bounded research agent.

## First run

Requires Python 3.12+ and `uv`.

```bash
uv sync
curl -L 'https://data.brreg.no/enhetsregisteret/api/enheter/lastned/csv' -o brreg-enheter.csv
curl -L 'https://builderr.ai/signalpost-company-universe-2025.jsonl.gz' -o signalpost-universe.jsonl.gz

python select_entry_batch.py \
  --universe signalpost-universe.jsonl.gz \
  --count 1000 \
  --output entry-companies.jsonl

uv run python scripts/run_competition_batch.py \
  --organisations entry-companies.jsonl \
  --bulk brreg-enheter.csv \
  --profiles-output out/profiles.jsonl \
  --output out/envelopes.jsonl \
  --report out/run-report.json \
  --run-id local-001 \
  --expected-count 1000

uv run pytest -q
```

Increase `--count` and `--expected-count` together if you want to publish more than the 1,000-company minimum. For a private smoke test before submission, make a 10-row input and change `--expected-count 10`.

## The improvement loop

1. Treat the organisation number as the anchor.
2. Generate site/profile candidates from official data, the company site, lawful search providers and named people.
3. Save every candidate and the evidence for or against it.
4. Publish only exact-entity matches. Parent, brand, franchise and similarly named companies are not exact.
5. Crawl static HTML first. Escalate to a browser only when a deterministic completeness check fails.
6. Measure added supported coverage, wrong-company claims, runtime, requests and cost.
7. Promote a strategy only when it improves coverage without weakening the accuracy gates.
8. Freeze strategies and thresholds before the daily evaluation run.

The strongest differentiator is external evidence that remains exact and auditable: official company pages, company-owned profiles, jobs, dated activity, ratings/reviews and permitted public signals. Do not trade accuracy for volume.

## Important source rule

Open-source code does not grant permission to scrape a platform. Follow each source's terms, robots policy, rate limits and licence. LinkedIn, Meta and Indeed are useful identity/discovery targets, but direct automated collection may be restricted. Use permitted APIs, licensed providers, company-owned outbound links, or return `blocked`/`not_available`.

Read `docs/competition-control-loop.md`, `docs/external-connectors.md` and the public source policy before adding connectors.

## Submission contract

Submit a repository with:

- at least 1,000 completed company profiles and the exact organisation-number manifest used;
- one documented command that accepts a JSONL batch of organisation numbers;
- exactly one terminal envelope per input;
- pinned dependencies and reproducible setup;
- a previous-snapshot input and material-change output;
- a machine-readable run report with runtime, request count and third-party cost;
- declared models, APIs, licences and source-rights assumptions.

Email the repository URL, run command, models/APIs and expected cost per 100-company run to `submit@builderr.ai`.

## Submitted 1,000-company run

The reproducible entry artifacts are in `submission/`:

- `manifest.jsonl`: the deterministic organisation-number input;
- `profiles.jsonl`: 1,000 completed public-data profiles;
- `envelopes.jsonl`: exactly one terminal envelope per input;
- `run-report.json`: request, runtime, source and validation evidence.

Re-run the entry with the official selected registry snapshot using:

```bash
uv run python scripts/run_competition_batch.py \
  --organisations submission/manifest.jsonl \
  --bulk data/raw/entry-registry-1000.json \
  --profiles-output out/profiles.jsonl \
  --output out/envelopes.jsonl \
  --report out/run-report.json \
  --run-id signalpost-full-1000-20260827 \
  --expected-count 1000 --workers 8 --checkpoint-every 25
```

The frozen registry snapshot is not duplicated in Git because it is a generated selection of the
official BRREG endpoint. Its SHA-256 and source URL are recorded in `run-report.json`; the adapter
and snapshot-integrity tests are included in this repository. The run used no paid API or model.
